        <p>Finding faith for me was hard. I was so skeptical that I needed to create rational, undeniable faith.</p>
        <p>Faith is this idea of a greater purpose from everything that you have experienced. To sum it up, it gives the person the mindset that everything that they cannot control was done for a reason. </p>
      <p>The key to faith is for it to be ultimately pragmatic, making doubt impossible. Everything I cannot control, happened for a reason, if it did not, it is better to think that it did. </p>
     <p>Now when trying to think this, when your child died from a rare terrible disease or your mom, dad, brother, son, daughter, or sister or all of the above die in a car accident it can feel 100x more difficult. The amount of pain caused in the past can make it near impossible to believe in some higher force of good. Villain stories and hero stories start from this same place, an insane amount of pain. Pain is a form of emotional energy and depression, vengeance, or righteousness are different places that pain can be converted into. The path of the hero is to believe that they were meant to experience that pain to make them realize the dedication needed for the higher path they can achieve. If not, it is better to think it. </p>
      <p>The claim that God has a greater plan is of the same accord, and I personally witnessed multiple Christians lose their faith in the face of tragedy. Atheists use this idea of gratuitous evil, or the holocaust to call it demonic to worship a god who would do such terrible acts. The solution to this is to focus not on being right or wrong, but on the pragmatic mindset of faith for the sake of it helping one enter a higher plan of being. One rooted in gratitude for the their present moment, allowing love to flow out from their center, helping to push the world away from these atrocities of the past and towards a future where these things do not happen. </p>
      <p>
      When the reason for faith is based upon a story, reconciling that tragedy with the story and losing sight of the pragmatic purpose of it, has someone fall victim to doubting faith. Rooting faith into the idea of having faith is the only real way to create an indestructible faith feedback loop. 
      </p>
      <p>
      As with all things, there can be TOO MUCH of something, or TOO LITTLE. Too much faith in the present moment where you can actionably take steps to change things, deserves doubt. Do help someone when they are choking, do not have faith. This graph below shows the distinction where faith is pragmatic.

        This atheist proof faith, acts as a universal doorway to belief in some great architect of the universe, or god. The fact that one should rationally have the best vibes about their past difficulties, may very well be the best evidence for divine inspiration in the creation of this all. If not, its just pretty cool that vibing at a higher level is the right reponse. 
        </p>
        <p>Put another way, everything you cannot control happened for a good reason not because a greater being made it that way, it does because it‚Äôs an opportunity to look at extreme tragedy through a positive lens. Because if this tragedy was not interconnected to a good story of humanity, it would truly just be tragic. Instead when we look at tragedy and force the idea of meaning upon it, the greatest tragedies push us to our greatest lengths to find that meaning. To find the story of who we have to become in order to even try to make that tragedy become this positive shift in who we are, and who we were meant to become.It‚Äôs a form of mental alchemy turn turns tragedy into becoming a hero.</p>
        <p>Love after all is an act of faith and loving the world in the face of great tragedy is a great test of faith.
For me, tragedy requires me to evaluate reality for truly what it is and what I can do about it. It‚Äôs a red pill of sorts that requires acceptance of what is, and a refocus on the highest path I can feasibly find. It is an unexpected bad dealing of cards that can‚Äôt be put back into the deck. It‚Äôs a reminder that time moves only in one direction and that all we can do is act to our highest degree.</p>
      <p>
      For me, this faith in faith, is really faith in the universe.
Faith in the idea that through becoming our highest selves, we will the gold at the end of the rainbow‚Ä¶ because if we do not. Did we really lose anything? Or have we only lost when we give up hope.
      </p>
      <p>
      It‚Äôs the same faith in a grand future that every major religion has embedded into the core of its system.
The fact of the matter is that if we ever do reach the pot of gold (heaven / utopia / nirvana), everything that happened in the past, even the tragedy, will actually truly find salvation. For appreciation for all that happened to lead us to this beauty will not be required, but a natural effect of the beauty. And maybe one day we‚Äôll be able to calculate just how rare it truly was that we made it. And on that day we will have nothing else to do but feel extreme gratitude toward every single tragic death that acted as a meaningful and necessary step in humanity making it.
      </p>
      <p>
      At that time, this deep question that feels unanswerable of ‚Äúwhy god did this happen to me‚Äù may end up being answered.
It is too bad that culture in religious groups which are called towards great works, have become  comfortable in this idea salvation. Acting like the very calling inside of Holy Texts is not to be an extremist of positive action. People are not then following the word of God, they‚Äôre all following the culture of one another. Putting man on the pedestal before God himself. Salvation should come in the form of gratitude not comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
      Too many fall trap to this. Holding onto real estate assets, upgrading their life for more comfort, and not treating others how they may want to be treated, performing mental masterbation watching sports. 
      </p>
      <p>
      As if the universe is separate from them and not wishing and calling forth action that pushes forward systemic change worldwide. As if the butterfly effect was not real. As if they did not matter. If we can ever collectively realize all of our individual worth, it will take humanity to new heights
      </p>

      The quest to do this is a quest of illumination. One who feels this light inside of them has a divine task to spread it to the world. While some may treat you like Pythagoreas telling Ancient Greece the earth is round, what you are spreading is pragmatic truths and nothing else. Through universality, these spiritual truths embedded into every major religion, we may find the greatest unification event around this idea proposed by philosopher Volatire.

        <q>‚ÄùIf God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.‚Äù </q>
      </p>
      <p>
      Besides the pragmatic utility of god‚Äôs existence, what about a rational explanation to explain it?

      The earth being flat may be a 1 in a billion reality, but what if we could use bayesian  to prove being an atheist was rationally more stupid than believing the earth is flat. We would need to devise a strong argument for the odds of being in a randomly occurring reality, being higher than a reality that had a creator / simulator / architect. 
      </p>
      <p>
      This idea already has more traction than most recognize, with the simulation theory being widely popular. Most do not recognize the implications of the simulation hypothesis. It tells a story of a more purposefully created reality, than a random one. While there are atheists who believe in simulation theory, this is clearly a paradox.
      </p>
      <p>
      Simulation theory uses Bayesian inference to put a higher probability on us being in a simulation, given the pattern of advancement we are experiencing, and our future potential for creating simulations. At the time when we do create a simulation, we would essentially seal the idea into statistical stone that we ourselves are in a simulated universe.
There are many articles online talking about simulation theory and the idea that we are in a simulation, within a simulation, within a simulation. 
      </p>
      <p>
      One idea gaining popularity is called Galactic Preschool Theory. Where the standard simulation hypothesis is based around a digital simulation, Galactic Preschool Theory is based on the idea of a physical simulation that humanity may itself run in the future. The idea is that once we reach utopia / post-scarcity new children will be unfulfilled and ungrateful if born into this environment. The solution will be to create an artificial physical simulation of how we went through dystopia to utopia so that they are not only able to become fulfilled through the process believing the risks were real, but also understanding how much better things are once they get there. NPC‚Äôs (aka non-player characters) will be utilized that pass the physical turing test so that agents will believe in all the gratuitous evil that occurs, and where the simulators do not actually need to impose evil on the world.
