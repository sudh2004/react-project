            The best way to spread the vibes is to be a vibe. Vibe transfer is real, and emotions control over behavior is a real faculty too.

            For anyone who was on any short form video platform during 2022, you saw the rise of “TOP G” Andrew Tate. He quickly became the most google planet on the entire earth. This is the main reason I add him to this list. It is not to say his entire encompassing self is great, it is to show that this Top V potential is unmatched given the global interconnectedness today.
            </p>
            <p>
            There are a lack of positive role models in society. The most famous influencers  are all telling stories low vibe stories, selling caffeine, fake sugar, chocolate bars, gambling, and alcohol. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Hence Top V representing the rise above Top G, which is mid-tier on the scale of vibes. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I actually first wrote Buddhism instead of Buddha so as to not claim myself a prophet, but alas it did not fit without a tiny font and so we had to take the risk of lash-back. At the end of the day false controversy may help the mission. Obviously not to the degree that Tate did it who was ultimately banned from all platforms.

            The mission of a Top V is towards faith,
Acts in the mission should never cause less faith,
Every act should be moving towards a reality you have more faith in.
Always towards more, but never towards denial of reality.
Moving towards faith should never deny reality / science. This is a way of making the path easier, by utilizing artificial faith. Faith should not give someone salvation to sit around and think of a better world, faith should empower you to use your hands, eyes, and ears to make that a reality.
            </p>
            <p>
            ositive faith can look like this:
Everyone needed to go through what we all did for us to be brought here to this divine moment, if this moment is not divine, it is better to think that it is.

              <summary> How To Vibe Lesson 1  </summary> 
<p>I’m not here to live for the moment, I’m here to live in the moment.</p>
<p>
Living for the moment means looking forward to exciting "moments" ahead of time, and anticipating them. So even before that moment, you can be living with the expectation of that moment. Similarly, even non-thrill-seekers may say they "live for the weekend", meaning they think all week about the activities or relaxation they will enjoy during the weekend.
</p>
<p>
On the contrary there are those living in the moment. These people of course still plan their lives, and have goals, but do not set expectations for their feelings based on future outcomes, they just seem to have the knack of enjoying (or at least accepting) whatever comes their way. Actually, this attitude/habit can be learned through meditation, particularly the kind that is now called mindfulness. It is exemplified by the motto "Be Here Now". These people do not seek "moments"; they seek for the serenity to accept calmly every moment, good or bad, without being distracted by thoughts of the past or the future.
</p>
       <p>
       Being truly present, allows one to take the RIGHT action. 
        </p> 
        <p>
        What makes an action any more right than others? Obviously right or wrong is a thing we define. What we realize we did wrong were the actions we took without thinking about the future. Taking the right actions means thinking as long term as it comes. 
        </p>   
        <p>
          <q>
          But I thought living in the moment meant giving up my future
          </q>
          </p>
          <p>
          WRONG. This is a poor translation of the real message here. The message is to be ever present with your emotions. To not let your goals and dreams set expectations that play with your emotions, opening a doorways for shame to come if things do not go as planned. 
            </p> 
            <p>
            In many moments of our life we know we are faced with a decision between the right choice, and the sub-concious choice towards pleasure or comfort. The right choice is the bigger vibe, you just need to frame it that way, so you can accept, understand, and get excited about your accomplishment in making that decision. 
            </p> 
            <p>
            You need to reward yourself internally for doing the right thing. What helped me was realizing that this idea of delaying gratification didn’t really work to make me excited. Now I do not think of it like delaying gratification, but building gratification. 
            </p>
            <p>
            When you take the short route, you’re just nutting early, and its your life rather than your wife who’s disappointed in you. It’s not about delaying the nut, it’s about feeling the passion along the way, and building towards it. Limiting simple artificial pleasure also makes the right path genuinely fun and exciting. It brings this “natural energy”.
            </p>
            <p>
            That mindset shift changed my ability to say no. Because I didn’t have to anymore. I get to say yes. Treat your life like a romantic partner and understand you are learning how to fall in love with YOU.
            </p>
            <p>
            When you live for a moment you are a slave to it.
When you live in the moment you are empowered to become who you want to be.

              <summary>Top V Lesson 2</summary>
              <p>
              If you actually <b>think being the ant that helped the other 3 cross is the real win here you are already a Top V.</b> 
              </p>
              <p>
              It only looks like the others got ahead, but when it comes to judging the value of our lives I believe we will all face a judgement day
              </p>
              <p>
              If you must cross, the real power move is to cross and then bring the others across the bridge too. To build a permanent bridge. Having big visions for the future means looking for these bridges to build, which takes the coordination of many to make happen.
              </p>
              <p>
              What is there to live for if we don’t? I choose to believe in a judgement day because every day is one. Everyday we act as the performer and the judge and the judge is the true decider of our happiness. We must seduce our judge with right actions and allow our judge to love us. Thereby allowing ourselves, to love us.
